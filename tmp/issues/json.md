Develope a roburst JSON lib (serialize/deserialize)
The system doesn't have a reoburst JSON lib yet.
Many components are using JSON in a very primitive way, which is manually construct JSON string.
After developing the JSON lib, replace all parts of codes that manually construct JSON string.
The whole system must use the roburst JSON lib.
