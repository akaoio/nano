OVERALL STATISTICS:
- Total functions analyzed: $(grep -c "(" reports/dead_code/function_definitions.txt 2>/dev/null || echo "0")
- Transport modules: $(ls src/lib/transport/*.c 2>/dev/null | wc -l)
- Report files generated: $(find reports/ -name "*.txt" | wc -l)

KEY FINDINGS:
- Check reports/architecture/ for system design insights
- Check reports/dead_code/ for optimization opportunities  
- Check reports/duplicates/ for refactoring candidates
