# üêõ Debugging Memory Issue - 2025-07-23 14:40:00

## Current Problem: Memory Corruption and Broken Pipe

### Symptoms:
1. **"free(): invalid size"** - Memory corruption during cleanup
2. **"Broken pipe"** - Client connection drops unexpectedly
3. **Server abort** - Process terminates abnormally

### Progress So Far:
‚úÖ Model loading works (rkllm.init successful)
‚úÖ JSON-RPC parsing works
‚úÖ Ultra-modular architecture implemented
‚úÖ Streaming callback system implemented
‚ùå Response handling has memory issues

### Analysis:
The issue occurs during response generation/sending, not during RKLLM operations. The model loads successfully but something in the JSON-RPC response handling causes memory corruption.

### Potential Causes:
1. **Double-free** in JSON object cleanup
2. **Buffer overflow** in response formatting
3. **String handling issue** in format_response
4. **Socket send/receive buffering**

### Next Debug Steps:
1. Add debug logging to response generation
2. Check format_response function for memory leaks
3. Simplify response to isolate the issue
4. Test with minimal JSON response

### Current Status:
- Foundation complete
- Need to fix response handling before proceeding
- Streaming architecture is correctly implemented
- Problem is in the response pipeline, not RKLLM integration
